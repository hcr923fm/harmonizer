# Harmonizer

Harmonizer is the software for a device (currently a Raspberry Pi 4) that keeps Myriad and the On-Air Studio *in sync*.

The device sits between a Sonifex RB-OA3 On-Air Switcher and it's control panels, allowing Harmonizer to be aware of when presenters are Offering/Accepting studio control. It also interfaces with PSquared Myriad v3, allowing Harmonizer to switch On-Air Control of Myriad when a studio switchover takes place - so that the instance of Myriad in the studio on air also has On-Air Control.
